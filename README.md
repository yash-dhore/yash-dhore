## Hello there 🤠 I'm Yash Dhore

I’m a passionate developer currently exploring machine learning, data analysis, and making simple videogames. With a solid foundation in programming languages like Java, C/C++, Python, SQL, and R, I'm committed to continuous learning and innovation.

Current Focus

- Machine Learning: Gaining hands-on experience with image classification at AbbVie, applying machine learning techniques to real-world problems.
- Game Development: Working on a JavaFX game, combining my programming skills with creative design.
